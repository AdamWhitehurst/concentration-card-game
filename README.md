###**The Concentration Game**-___It's simple. Match two cards, get a point. But we also count your failures.___

This matching game is made possible with the wonderful [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/). When you press "New Game," the API creates a new deck of only the Hearts and Spades suits, while the game logic will pull, shuffle then pull again that deck from the API, creating a deck of 52 cards, 26 pairs.


This project is made with three ingredients:

[**React.js**](https://reactjs.org/) For the UI framework, using only hooks for state and my best attempt at functional programming :)

[**Styled-Components**](https://www.styled-components.com/) For component styling

[**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios) For API data fetching
